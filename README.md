An attempt at League of Legends match prediction versus broadly available Pinnacle lines.

This Project will include:

1) an interaction with various gambling site APIs to get live odds for League of Legends Matches
2) A rating of team strengths from prior games and statistics
3) An interpreter of the above to predict win-rates in given matchups and compare those to public lines


Later Extensions:

1) Draft adjustments, i.e. how should the teams drafted affect odds.
